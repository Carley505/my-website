## 🏁 How to Run

Since this is a static website, you can run it locally in several ways:

### 1. Direct Open (Simplest)
Simply double-click the `index.html` file in your file explorer to open it in your default web browser.

### 2. Python HTTP Server (Recommended for developers)
If you have Python installed, you can start a local server by running one of the following commands in the project root:

**Python 3:**
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then visit: `http://localhost:8000`

### 3. Node.js `http-server`
If you have Node.js installed, you can use `npx` to run a temporary server:
```bash
npx http-server .
```
Then visit: `http://localhost:8080` (or the port specified in the terminal).
